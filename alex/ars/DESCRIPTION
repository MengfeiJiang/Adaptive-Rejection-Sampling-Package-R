Description: R implementation of the Adaptive Rejection Sampling algortihm
    as described in Gilks et al. (1992). It is used to efficiently generate
    random values from unimodal distributions that otherwise are difficult to
    sample from. The adaptive rejection sampler defines an upper hull via
    the tangent method and a lower hull that is minimized to ensure acceptable
    values are drawn from an approximation of the target distribution. 
    Tests are carried out to check the validity of the input distribution function,
    so that it fulfills the criteria of the algorthim (e.g. log-concave density).
